That’s because the population scandalized by war is ready to stop it at nearly any cost. In this war, a secret war, the degree of scandal is not for the population to regulate because it has occurred surreptitiously, unconsciously, and the cost of educating them as to the extent of casualties sustained would protract the conflict indefinitely. No, the one who has been greatly offended is God Almighty, and he is a Man of War. It s not easy to get to that headspace. Who has driven themselves deeply insane for the sake of these? Who has drilled miles below the surface, kicked themselves horizontal, gone miles further, and fractured the substrate to perform resource extraction to power the recovery we need?  \n",

       "1974  If all men were flawless, perfect and immortal then your points would hold merit. But men kill, husbands abused the family power and status they had (and still do in many parts of the world) and husbands die in the workplace, leaving their wives and kids without their breadwinner . It really wasn t surprising that eventually the other half would aspire to be more. Ultimately, men and women are still the same animal, the difference is one chromosome...thats it. Its no surprise that many would see mens successes and aspire to have the same opportunity. But things are never really that simple are they, humans are a flawed species, anything we hope to build, we end up ultimately destroying. Your ideal family unit for example would have work perfectly if there hadn t been some who ultimately ruined it. If the church had not come along and told their female beleivers that they were inferior, only good enough for those specific roles.  "

THAT s the history you are doomed to repeat. we literally have a chance like no other right now. you think people don t fucking hate spics, jews, and nogs at an all time high? and yes this is a prime opportunity and the last possible opportunity, for a major pushback and return to order. once our generation dies off, there will be no one left who was alive for the world that existed before all of this, no one who remembers what it was like to not worry about getting jumped when you walked down the street at night, to not worry about gangs, to know all your neighbors and to hear them all speak english, to not worry about your children running off to play for the day, to not hear muslim chants coming from the local mosque, to not watch your child be the only white child in a room full of people being told them and their ancestors are responsible for all their problems, etc the freedom just to be able to hold a fucking picnic without a pack of joggers spotting it and taking everything</td>\n",

That’s because the population scandalized by war is ready to stop it at nearly any cost. In this war, a secret war, the degree of scandal is not for the population to regulate because it has occurred surreptitiously, unconsciously, and the cost of educating them as to the extent of casualties sustained would protract the conflict indefinitely. No, the one who has been greatly offended is God Almighty, and he is a Man of War. It s not easy to get to that headspace. Who has driven themselves deeply insane for the sake of these?

There’s not much you can do to get the kind of equipment and training to deal with that without being in genuine combat and treating those wounds Are you retarded? Read about the Battle of Mogadishu. M855A1 was going through skinnies at rates of 5 rounds per person before they went down and even then they still had some fight.

That’s because the population scandalized by war is ready to stop it at nearly any cost. In this war, a secret war, the degree of scandal is not for the population to regulate because it has occurred surreptitiously, unconsciously, and the cost of educating them as to the extent of casualties sustained would protract the conflict indefinitely. No, the one who has been greatly offended is God Almighty, and he is a Man of War. It s not easy to get to that headspace. Who has driven themselves deeply insane for the sake of these? Who has drilled miles below the surface, kicked themselves horizontal, gone miles further, and fractured the substrate to perform resource extraction to power the recovery we need?  "

Contingent to the previous points, without the strength of the male wage, the family becomes prohibitively expensive. What was once the social norm becomes instead an extravagant luxury only slightly less costly and less unattainable than a high-class yacht. The pressure to not have children becomes immense, and women enter a state of postponement. I ll have a family, but later, when I ve saved up enough money. I ll have kids, but later, right now I need to secure a future for them. I want to have a family, but I can always do it later when the situation looks better, right now I can just party and enjoy myself, after all, it s not like I could have one now anyway even if I wanted to. But the cold reality of nature is that, while men continuously produce healthy sperm until the day they die, women have a finite number of eggs. And the longer she goes without having children, the greater the likelihood that there will be complications or congenital birth defects. The possibility of a child being born with issues such as autism, general learning disabilities, and Downs syndrome become markedly increased the older the mother is, and the age of the mother has also been linked to problems such as birth defects, miscarriages, and even Sudden Infant Death syndrome.</td>\n",

The arguments drew weaponised autist researchers who uncovered mass CIA participation in the entire games and games journalism industry. I never got that interested, but last time I checked on it, Clinton was involved. Specifically the incident with the embassy raid in Benghazi. One of the casualties from the CIA annex was apparently the CFO of Goonsquad in Eve Online and was using Eve to launder money for the Clinton foundation. I didn t bother looking for proof, just chuckled at it and went back to being a wagie coomer. It was a different time. When the history books are written, I hope its noted that the times we live in now are not an age of chaos but an age of consequences for the chaos that preceded.  \n",

       "232   And finally, the sixth and final reason bringing women into the workplace was a mistake is because It encourages them to not have families or children at all. Contingent to the previous points, without the strength of the male wage, the family becomes prohibitively expensive. What was once the social norm becomes instead an extravagant luxury only slightly less costly and less unattainable than a high-class yacht. The pressure to not have children becomes immense, and women enter a state of postponement. I ll have a family, but later, when I ve saved up enough money. I ll have kids, but later, right now I need to secure a future for them. I want to have a family, but I can always do it later when the situation looks better, right now I can just party and enjoy myself, after all, it s not like I could have one now anyway even if I wanted to. But the cold reality of nature is that, while men continuously produce healthy sperm until the day they die, women have a finite number of eggs. And the longer she goes without having children, the greater the likelihood that there will be complications or congenital birth defects. The possibility of a child being born with issues such as autism, general learning disabilities, and Downs syndrome become markedly increased the older the mother is, and the age of the mother has also been linked to problems such as birth defects, miscarriages, and even Sudden Infant Death syndrome.  \n",

Even that is not even close to enough room... the dam was apparently supposed to be 275m tall according to Soviet engineers that originally designed the dam for Mao. They dropped it to for the sole purpose of saving more land for building, even though its not enough height to do any of its designed jobs correctly.  \n",

And other countries too but especially China. YES This is exactly right. If the businesses all pulled out it would solve the problem. The global corporations built up China s economy. They did the same exact thing before WWII with Germany. THIS CAN NOT BE A CYCLE FOR THE FUTURE Global Businesses can not just keep building up nations to fight against America and then pretend like nothing happened going off to build up another nation.  \n",

But men kill, husbands abused the family power and status they had (and still do in many parts of the world) and husbands die in the workplace, leaving their wives and kids without their breadwinner . It really wasn t surprising that eventually the other half would aspire to be more. Ultimately, men and women are still the same animal, the difference is one chromosome...thats it. Its no surprise that many would see mens successes and aspire to have the same opportunity. But things are never really that simple are they, humans are a flawed species, anything we hope to build, we end up ultimately destroying. Your ideal family unit for example would have work perfectly if there hadn t been some who ultimately ruined it. If the church had not come along and told their female beleivers that they were inferior, only good enough for those specific roles.  "
